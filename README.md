# My Profile Website

Hello! Welcome to the GitHub page of my profile website! The purpose of this project ist for me 
to learn about front end and implement that idea to a real life need such as an online cv. I 
made this project with HTML, mainly CSS, a bit of JavaScript and all of these then got 
bootstrapped by REACT. 

This website will be always under development as many aspects of my life will be too! Thanks for 
visiting, and you may contact me anytime for further information.
